# BTC-ENET-2019-Smart-Parking-Garage
BTC ENET class of 2019 capstone project - Smart Parking Garage

The Self-Parking Car Garage is a scaled-down conceptual design for a single-attendant parking garage that maneuvers vehicles to a specified location and retrieves vehicles without driver intervention. This project is a culmination of organized planning, time management skills, and expertise in electronics principles gained both in-class and independently over the span of three academic quarters. Each student that participated in this project took the initiative to push the scope of the program, often independently studying and applying new concepts in order to rise to the unique challenges that were presented. In the planning process, we were required to adhere to this short list of criteria:

- Upon entering the garage, vehicles operation must be completely automated.
- There could be a single attendant to handle check-in and check-out procedures.
- The garage must be capable of storing multiple vehicles.

Using the amount of creative license we were given in realizing these goals, we decided that we would achieve automation through a combination of bluetooth communication and light-guided control. This design choice afforded the opportunity to accommodate multiple vehicles at once. Taking advantage of the optional attendant, we decided to include a kiosk with a control console that is capable of managing client-side tasks.
